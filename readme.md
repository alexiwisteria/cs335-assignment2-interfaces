<h1>Assignment #2 - Interfaces</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
In some capacity, each of you have run into the following concepts in your educational/professional path:

- Interfaces
- Constructors
- Private vs Public attributes
- Annotations
- Maven
- JUnit

These components are going to be critical as we move through the rest of this course.  Therefore, your first coding
assignment will be to work through these some of these details.

Your assignment is to implement the contents of methods for the following classes that implemment the Shape interface:

- Circle
- Rectangle
- Square

Each class above must implement the Shape interface and have a constructor appropriate to the class type for the
required calculations.

<b>NOTE: Do NOT change the Shape interface in any capacity nor the unit tests.</b>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
Once you have successfully complete your code (it must both compile and pass the unit tests), run the following:

mvn clean
